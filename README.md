HART Core Systems is one of many departments contributing to the completion of the Honolulu Rail Transit Project. This specific team associated with the Github organization represents a subsection of the HART county interns and engineers that develop software for a multitude of purposes for the HRTP such as ride quality analysis and construction inspection. This collection of projects are mostly created by interns mentored by Core Systems engineers.
